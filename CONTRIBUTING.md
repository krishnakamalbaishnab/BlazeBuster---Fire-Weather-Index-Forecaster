### Before You Start

1. Check the [Issues](https://github.com/krishnakamalbaishnab/BlazeBuster---Fire-Weather-Index-Forecaster/issues) page to see if your feature/bug is already being worked on
2. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change
3. Make sure your development environment is set up correctly

## üìù Code Style

### Python Code

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task

### HTML/CSS

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Follow consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Use meaningful class names
- Keep CSS organized and commented

### Example Python Function

```python
def calculate_fire_risk(fwi_value):
    """
    Calculate fire risk level based on FWI value.
    
    Args:
        fwi_value (float): Fire Weather Index value
        
    Returns:
        str: Risk level ('low', 'moderate', 'high', 'extreme')
    """
    if fwi_value < 5:
        return 'low'
    elif fwi_value < 15:
        return 'moderate'
    elif fwi_value < 25:
        return 'high'
    else:
        return 'extreme'
```
